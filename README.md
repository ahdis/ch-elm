## Terminology handling

Terminology is handled by the FOPH directly on the ABN environment.

To update the current ValueSets and CodeSystem in the FHIR Implementation Guide there is a script in tests/updateterminolgy.sh which will
call the ABN environment API and copy the resources into the input\resources folder.
