# Caused by the underlying profiles 
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# Logical model only integrated as abstract data model
Constraint failed: eld-20: 'Element names should be simple alphanumerics with a max of 64 characters, or code generation tools may be broken'
