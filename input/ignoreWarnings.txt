Entry 'http://test.fhir.ch/r4/DiagnosticReport/1DR-NeisseriaGonorrhoeae' isn't reachable by traversing forwards from the Composition. Only Provenance is approved to be used this way (R4 section 3.3.1)
Found multiple matching profiles for Patient/1Pat-DM among choices: http://hl7.eu/fhir/laboratory/StructureDefinition/Patient-animal-eu-lab, http://hl7.eu/fhir/laboratory/StructureDefinition/Patient-eu-lab, http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient

# Caused by the underlying profiles 
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
